# OSI Layer 1 — Physical Layer

## Overview

The **Physical Layer (Layer 1)** is the lowest layer of the OSI Model. Its primary responsibility is transmitting and receiving **raw bits** across the physical medium.

Unlike higher layers that deal with logical communication, Layer 1 focuses on the **electrical, optical, and mechanical characteristics** of network communication.

Its primary responsibilities include:

- Transmitting and receiving raw bits
- Defining physical media (copper, fiber, wireless)
- Defining connectors and interfaces
- Specifying signaling methods
- Supporting physical network connectivity

Layer 1 does **not** understand frames, packets, or IP addresses—it only handles **bits (0s and 1s)**.

## Responsibilities of Layer 1

The Physical Layer is responsible for the actual transmission of data across the network medium.

- Converts bits into electrical, optical, or radio signals
- Receives signals and converts them back into bits
- Defines cable types
- Defines connector types
- Defines transmission speed
- Defines maximum cable distance
- Defines physical interface standards

## Physical Transmission Media

Layer 1 can transmit data using different physical media depending on the network environment.

| Media | Signal Type | Typical Usage |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| Copper Cable | Electrical | LAN |
| Fiber Optic Cable | Light | LAN Backbone, Campus |
| Wireless | Radio Waves | Wi-Fi |

## Copper (UTP) Cable

The most common cable used in Ethernet LANs is **UTP (Unshielded Twisted Pair)**.

Characteristics:

- Uses RJ-45 connectors
- Maximum cable length: **100 meters**
- Commonly connects:
  - PCs
  - Printers
  - IP Phones
  - Switches
  - Routers

Example:

PC ─────────── Switch
      UTP Cable
```

## UTP Cable Categories

Over time, Ethernet speeds have increased, requiring higher-quality copper cabling.

| Category | Maximum Speed |
|----------|---------------|
| Cat5 | 100 Mbps |
| Cat5e | 1 Gbps |
| Cat6 | 10 Gbps |
| Cat6a | 10 Gbps |
| Cat7 | 10 Gbps |
| Cat8 | 40 Gbps |

> Always ensure the installed cable category supports the bandwidth required by your network equipment.

## Straight-Through vs Crossover Cable

UTP cables can be wired in two different ways.

### Straight-Through Cable

Most commonly used.

Used to connect **different device types**.

Examples:

- PC → Switch
- Router → Switch
- Server → Switch

```text
PC ───────── Switch
```

### Crossover Cable

Used to connect **same device types** directly.

Examples:

- Switch ↔ Switch
- PC ↔ PC
- Router ↔ Router

```text
Switch ─────── Switch
```

Today, most modern switches support **Auto MDI-X**, allowing either straight-through or crossover cables to work automatically.

## Auto MDI-X

Modern Ethernet devices can automatically detect transmit (TX) and receive (RX) pairs.

Benefits:

- No need to manually choose crossover cables
- Simplifies network installation
- Automatically adjusts wiring internally

## Fiber Optic Cable

Fiber optic cables transmit data using **light** instead of electricity.

Advantages:

- Higher bandwidth
- Longer transmission distances
- Immune to electromagnetic interference (EMI)

Common uses:

- Building-to-building connections
- Campus networks
- Data centers
- High-speed switch uplinks

## Fiber Types

There are two major types of fiber optic cable.

| Type | Distance | Bandwidth | Cost |
|------|----------|-----------|------|
| Multi Mode (MMF) | Hundreds of meters | High | Lower |
| Single Mode (SMF) | Hundreds of kilometers | Very High | Higher |

### Multi Mode Fiber (MMF)

Characteristics:

- Shorter distance
- Less expensive
- Common inside buildings and campuses

Typical maximum distance:

- Around **150–400 meters** depending on Ethernet standard.

### Single Mode Fiber (SMF)

Characteristics:

- Extremely long distance
- Highest bandwidth
- More expensive optics

Typical uses:

- ISP backbone
- Long-distance links
- Inter-city connectivity

## Fiber Connectors

Unlike copper cables, fiber cables usually connect to a **transceiver module** before connecting to the switch.

Different fiber standards require different connector and transceiver types.

## Power over Ethernet (PoE)

**Power over Ethernet (PoE)** allows electrical power and network connectivity to be delivered through the same Ethernet cable.

Instead of requiring:

- Network cable
- Separate power adapter

only **one Ethernet cable** is needed.

## Devices That Commonly Use PoE

| Device | Uses PoE |
|---------|-----------|
| IP Phone | ✅ |
| Wireless Access Point | ✅ |
| IP Camera | ✅ |
| VoIP Phone | ✅ |

## Benefits of PoE

Advantages include:

- Less cabling
- Easier installation
- Cleaner workspaces
- Centralized power management
- Useful where electrical outlets are unavailable

Example:

```text

      │
      ├──────── IP Phone
      │
      ├──────── Wireless AP
      │
      └──────── IP Camera
```

## PoE Injector

If an existing switch does **not** support PoE, a **PoE Injector** can be used.

The injector adds power to the Ethernet cable while preserving network connectivity.

This is especially useful when deploying devices in locations where power outlets are difficult to install.

## Copper vs Fiber Comparison

| Maximum Speed | Up to 40 Gbps (Cat8) | 100+ Gbps |
| EMI Resistance | No | Yes |
| Cost | Lower | Higher |
| Common Usage | PCs, Switches | Backbone, Campus, Data Center |

## Layer 1 vs Layer 2

| Feature | Layer 1 | Layer 2 |

| PDU | Bits | Frame |
| Primary Responsibility | Physical transmission | Framing & MAC addressing |
| Addressing | None | MAC Address |
| Media | Copper, Fiber, Wireless | Ethernet |
